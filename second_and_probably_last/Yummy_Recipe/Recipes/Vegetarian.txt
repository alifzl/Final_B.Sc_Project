--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        pounds  beans
       1      teaspoon  salt (omitted)
       1      teaspoon  mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
       1          dash  hot sauce
       1      teaspoon  hot chili
     1/2           cup  onion
     1/4           cup  molasses or honey
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
       8     teaspoons  white sugar
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  white vinegar

Presoak beans.  Drain.  Combine dry ingredients and mix with beans; stir in other ingredients.  Pour into 1 1/2 qt. or 2 qt. baking dish or bean pot. [Obviously, if you double the recipe like I did, you'll need a bigger pot :-]  Pour in boiling water to cover.  Cover.  Bake at 300 degrees for 6 hours; add a bit of boiling water if needed.  (Crock-pot method: cook on low 8-10 hours.)  Comments:  I just dumped everything on top of the beans and stirred them; then covered them with hot tap water.  They took a lot longer than 10 hours to cook, but that might have been due to too-low heat on the crockpot. (Also, reportedly vinegar and other acid substances need to be added at the end of cooking else they'll make the beans tough.)  These beans were *really* good.  The caramelized onions were even better. I've enjoyed the beans plain, with barbecue sauce, and with spinach and corn added.

       2        pounds  asparagus
       2         large  potatoes
       2   tablespoons  dill
     1/4           cup  flour
       1           cup  rice milk
       1                salt

Cut potatoes into small pieces.  In an approximately 3 qt. saucepan, boil potatoes until extremely tender.  While this is happening, wash asparagus. Remove woody ends.  Cut into 1" sections, setting aside tips.  Add non-tip sections to potato pot and cook until asparagus has gone beyond bright green to olive green (but not brown :)).  Add dill.  Asparagus should be soft enough to mash along with potatoes, in the cooking water.  Don't throw out any of the cooking water.

 lightly brown flour in a small saucepan and allow to cool somewhat before adding rice milk.  Add liquid gradually to make a smooth pseudo-roux and add the roux to the soup. Add the asparagus tips and continue cooking the soup just until they are tender and bright green. Salt to taste. Yum.

Mix sugars and add applesauce.  Sift together dry ingredients and stir in. Add oats and raisins.  Drop by spoonfuls onto lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees about 10 minutes.

 Note:  I left out the raisins because I don't care for them. Also, I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  The next time I make these I may cut back on the sugar because they are rather sweet.  These cookies were nice and fluffy (for a fat-less cookie) and remind me of muffins.  These are so quick and easy to make, I just love them!  I hope everyone enjoys them.

Paneer is soft white 'farmer' cheese that is commonly used in India.  I substituted reduced-fat White Wave tofu, and it takes the place of paneer very well. This takes about 1/2 hour to make.

 start some rice  cut 1 brick tofu into cubes and bake in 300 degree oven while you prepare sauce.

 1 onion (slice very thinly and saute in your favorite medium until browned) 1 t. pressed garlic (in with the onion)  1 c. water 1 t. ginger 1 T. cumin 1 T. coriander 1/2 t. clove 1/4 t. methi (fenugreek) 1 t. salt  add spices to onion/garlic at last minute of saute.  Stir until distributed and then add water.

 mix: 2 t. gram flour (chickpea flour, besan) enough water to make a thin, smooth paste  add a family size package of frozen green peas to the sauce, and cook until hot.

 dribble in the chickpea flour mixture, while stirring.  The sauce will thicken.

 add: 1 cup of ground tomatoes or tomato puree juice of one lemon  stir, adjust seasonings.

 Add tofu and simmer until it absorbs some of the seasonings.  Add more water if necessary.

 serve with rice  Posted by cgibas@cysteine.ncsa.uiuc.edu (Cynthia Gibas) to the Fatfree Digest [Volume 16 Issue 7] Mar. 11, 1995.

     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese

All measurings except the six noodles (which serves 2) are approximate. Really, I guess you can put in about anything you like.  I left the mushrooms out of Ben's because he's weird that way.  Anyway, stuff this mixture into the shells. You may have some left over. So sue me.  Put them in a baking dish and pour one jar of Healthy Choice f/f spaghetti sauce over the noodles.   Bake at 400 F for about 45 minutes.  This is very easy and I hope you like it as well as we do. Mangia!

My daughter makes a wonderful marinated marinaded stir fry.  She marinades the Mari-Nu low fat tofu and veggies in soy sauce, garlic and onions. You can cook the marinade for a few minutes to get the flavors of the garlic and onions.  Just pour over pieces of tofu and any veggies you may have on hand or like.

 Cook the veggies first, add in some of the marinade (I steam them in the microwave).  I put everything in a non stick frying pan ( I think my daughter does this as well).  When cooked, we serve it over brown basmati rice.

     2/3           cup  rice milk
       1                egg sub. equivalent for 1
                        egg
       1    tablespoon  applesauce (sub. for

       2          cups  bread flour
     1/3           cup  oat flour (process rolled

       4     teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  yeast
     1/3           cup  maple syrup
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2           cup  raisins -- (1/2 to 1)
     2/3           cup  rolled oats -- toasted in 350
                        oven for 10min. or until
                        light brown

Add the first 8 ingredients to bread machine according to manufacturer's  instructions.  Set it for the dough setting (mine calls it the manual cycle).  When cycle is complete, remove dough from machine.   Cover and let rise 10 min.  In a small saucepan, stir together the syrup, spices and brown sugar. Cook over low heat until sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and stir in raisins and toasted rolled oats. Set aside.

On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12x8 rectangle.  Spread raisin mixture over dough to all edges.  Roll up jelly roll style, pinch seams to seal.  Cut into 1 inch slices.  Place rolls, cut sides down, on non stick cookie sheet. I gave my sheet a couple of spritzs with cooking spray and I think it helped. When the rolls come out, you need to use a spatula to pry them off the pan, because the brown sugar will have stuck, but they come right up. These had just the right amount of sweetness. Enjoy!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  millet -- rinsed and drained
       2          cups  boiling water
     1/2         pound  beets, scrubbed, trimmed
                        and cut into 1/2*inch dice
                        (no need
                        to peel.
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  allspice
       1    tablespoon  fresh orange zest
       2                oranges)
       2   tablespoons  minced fresh mint
       6   tablespoons  fresh orange juice
                        salt -- to taste

Heat nonstick or cast iron skillet over high heat.  Toast millet till it gives off a nice popcorn smell and starts to dance about the pan. Place millet in pressure cooker pot when done.

Heat flame tamer and place pressure cooker on top.  Add boiling water, beets, salt, and allspice to pressure cooker.  Lock lid and bring up to high pressure.  When high pressure is reached, turn down heat to maintain pressure and hold for 10 minutes (set a timer).

Meanwhile, zest one of the oranges.  You should get a yield of 1 T, if not, use the other orange as well.  (If you don't have a zester, use a sharp potato peeler to delicately remove just the orange peel, leaving the bitter white pith behind.) Mince the orange zest.  Set aside. Squish the oranges without breaking them by rolling them between your hands and the counter. This will make juicing go easier.  Cut in half and juice. You should get 6 T or so.  Since oranges vary in sweetness, you will want to add the orange juice by taste.

Mince the mint and set aside.

After the 10 minutes are up on the pressure cooker, turn off heat and move it to a cold burner.  Let sit for 10 minutes and then take cooker to sink. Run under cold water to release any residual pressure and remove lid.

Add mint and zest.  Add orange juice to taste, and salt if needed. Serve.

This dish looked stunning in my black octagonal serving dish.  A splash of lemon or lime might also be tasty.

A near-empty refrigerator can breed creativity:

 1.  Mix some ff plain yogurt with dill weed, celery seed, and a little salt. Put it in a small container.

 2.  Put some cooked brown rice in another, larger container.

 3.  At lunchtime, mix the seasoned yogurt into the rice. At 6:30 this morning I thought, "Girl, you MUST be desperate." At 1:00 this afternoon I enjoyed a delicious lunch.

Put water and beans in saucepan on med high heat. Add all ingredients except salsa and tortillas. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and let cook til lentils are soft, about 45 minutes. (Keep stirring because the beans will stick to the bottom of the pot.) Once the beans are mushy, add salsa, stir well.

 Place in tortillas, garnish as desired, and enjoy.

 NOTE: I didn't soak the beans beforehand and haven't experienced any problems. Mary McD says, in this book, that you don't need to soak lentils.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       7        ounces  brown rice
       1                onion -- chopped fine
       1         clove  garlic -- chopped fine
       1      teaspoon  rosemary
     1/3         ounce  mushrooms -- soaked
     7/8           cup  vegetable broth
     7/8           cup  merlot or other red wine
       2        ounces  parmesan cheese
                        salt -- pepper

1. Cook the rice for 15 minutes in 1 3/4 cups of water.

 2. Squeeze out the mushrooms and chop them. Saute the onion and garlic in your favorite liquid, add the rosemary and mushrooms, and boil rapidly. Add the rice and bring to a boil.

 3. Add the broth and wine, and cook for 10 minutes over a low flame. (Note ~ at this point I had much too much liquid, so I let it cook with the top off until enough had boiled away.)  4. Season to taste with salt and pepper, add the parmesan, and serve promptly.

 (the original advises eating promptly so it doesn't get too dry; I didn't find this to be a problem, and even reheated it for a couple of days).

                     Irish Whole-Grain Soda Bread (Lacto)

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time : 1:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cups  flour -- plus
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt
   1 1/2     teaspoons  baking soda
       1           cup  rolled oats
       2          cups  buttermilk
       2   tablespoons  dark molasses

This version, flavored with old-fashioned rolled oats and dark molasses, is similar to the soda bread served at Ballymaloe House in County Cork, Ireland.  Bake the bread early in the day and reheat it just before the guests arrive.

 Thoroughly combine ww and all-purpose flours, baking soda and salt in large bowl. Stir in oats and make well in center.

 Combine buttermilk and molasses in separate bowl. Pour mixture into flour well and gradually work into flour with fingers or spoon.

 Knead dough lightly 3 or 4 times on floured surface and divide in half. Shape into 2 round loaves, each about 5-inch in diameter. With sharp knife, score loaves with cross slash, cutting 1 inch deep.

 Place loaves on ungreased baking sheet and bake at 425 degrees 15 minutes, then reduce heat and continue to bake 25 to 30 minutes longer or until loaves are brown on top and sound hollow when tapped on bottom. Cool at least 5 minutes on cooling rack.  Loaves can be baked several hours ahead and reheated in low oven.  Cut into thick or thin wedges.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

 Makes 2 loaves, 8 servings each. Each serving contains: 140 calories; 257 mg sodium; 1 mg cholesterol; 1 gram fat; 28 grams carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 0.55 grams fiber.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Add all of the dried ingredients in a large bowl and mix very well.  Pour all of the milk into the bowl and stir until a soft dough is formed. It will not be smooth at this point. Pour out onto counter and knead the sticky mess for a few minutes.

 Divide into two portions and shape into two round loaves, press down a bit to barely flatten. Place on non-stick cookie sheet, slash a cross across the top.

 Allow loaves to rest 10 minutes then bake for 40 minutes, or until loaves are golden. Very nice with jam.

Put seitan, veggies (except celery), and herbs and spices in a large pot (Dutch oven or small stock pot will do).  Saute in a little water or veggie broth at medium heat for about 8 minutes, stirring to prevent burning. Add water and tamari and bring to a simmer. Cook about 10 more minutes or until veggies are soft.

 Add celery (add at end to help retain color and texture).

 Mix the 4 T cold water with the cornstarch.  Turn off heat under stew. Vigorously stir in cornstarch solution.  Turn heat back on under stew and stir until thickened.

Peel potatoes, cut into cubes and boil in water until tender. Mash (may want to add a little water to make mashing them easier).

 Water/broth saute onions and garlic.  Add to mashed potatoes. Add bread crumbs, curry powder and salt.  Cool enough to handle.

 Form 10 to 12 four inch diameter patties and brown them in a non-stick pan sprayed with non-stick spray.

 You can also add cooked carrots, peas, and any other soft cooked vegetables to the potato mixture before browning them. Serve as is or with some Indian condiments like mango chutney or coriander chutney. These patties are pretty easy to make and really good.

       1         quart  water
      10        slices  fresh ginger
     1/2           cup  slivered seitan

     1/2           cup  frozen baby peas -- rinsed and
                        thawed
       4                scallions -- whites thin
                        sliced -- greens cut on thin
                        diagonals -- 2kept separate
       2                t's rice vinegar
                        (unseasoned)
       1    tablespoon  mirin
       2                t's tamari
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh black pepper
   1 1/2                t's arrowroot
     1/8      teaspoon  crushed red pepper (or to
                        taste)

PROCEDURE. Cut and prepare all of the fresh and dried veggies, tofu and seitan.

 After the black mushrooms and lily flowers have been soaked and drained, cut them up so they are not too stringy.  NOTE:  AVAILABLE ONLY AT ASIAN GROCERY STORE **.

 Simmer the first 3 ingredients for one minute and then remove the ginger.

 Combine the last 6 ingredients in a bowl and mix.

 Add the carrots, chinese cabbage and black mushrooms to the stock and simmer for 2 minutes.

 Add everything else except the scallion greens and baby peas and simmer another 2 minutes.  Be sure to recirculate the last 6 ingredients in the bowl to recirculate the arrowroot before adding to the soup.

 Add baby peas, adjust the seasonings and serve very hot in bowls.

 Garnish with scallion greens.

 My own note:  After tasting this, I could not tell the difference between this and the chicken hot and sour served at the local Chinese Restaurants.

       2          cups  brown basmati rice
     1/2           cup  wild rice
     1/2         pound  frozen black-eyed peas
       1      10 ounce  ba  frozen mustard greens
       1      10 ounce  ba  frozen collard greens
   5 1/2          cups  water
       1      teaspoon  basil

       1      teaspoon  to 1*t old bay seasoning
       2          cans  stewed tomatoes with liquid

This is a variation of something my grandmother used to make with h*m hocks. It's a long way from the original. This makes approx. 5 qts., enough to freeze half or feed a crowd.

 Put the water in the cooker, turn burner to high. Stir in spices.  Rinse rices and put in cooker.  Throw in black-eyed peas, greens, and stewed tomatoes. Bring to simmer with the top off, stirring occasionally, until frozen stuff has thawed somewhat and greens are separated.  Lock the lid down, bring to high pressure. Cook at high pressure for 30 minutes, remove from heat and allow natural pressure release. Adjust seasoning if necessary. tabasco sauce is a must on the table.

 I use an 8-qt.cooker, cut recipe in half if you use a smaller cooker.

       1         pound  beans
       1                salt and pepper

Mince garlic very finely and blend into mayo along with vinegar.  Set aside to let flavors to blend.  Scrub potatoes well and cut into 1-1 1/2" pieces. Place in steamer basket and steam until just tender (10-15 min).  While the potatoes steam, trim ends off green beans and snap them in half.  Rinse potatoes under cold water and place in strainer to cool while you steam the green beans just until crisp-tender (3-5 min).  Rinse beans under cold water until cool and place in strainer to drain. Toss potatoes and beans with mayo mixture to coat and season with salt and pepper. You can chill this or just eat it at room temperature. I imagine some red, yellow or green bell pepper would also be good with this or maybe a little onion or celery.

Add the carrots, celery, mushrooms, lentils, boiling water, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and red pepper flakes.

 Lock lid in place.  Over high heat, bring to a high pressure.  Lower the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 7 minutes. Allow the pressure to come down naturally or use a quick-release method. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. If the lentils are not quite tender, either return to high pressure for a few more minutes or replace (but do not lock) the lid and simmer until the lentils are done.

 Remove the bay leaves.  Stir in the roasted red bell peppers, parsley, just enough vinegar to bring up the flavors, and salt and pepper to taste.

Take a pan that can go from stove to table; I have an 8-inch diameter enameled steel casserole that works well.

 Peel, core, and slice the apple. Place it in the pan with the prunes, sugar, water, and lemon juice. Bring it to a boil.

 While it is heating, sift the flour with baking powder and salt, then stir in the milk and apple sauce. Drop the mixture by teaspoonfuls onto the hot fruit, then sprinkle with the remaining tablespoonful of sugar.

 Cover the pan and simmer for 15 mins. Serve hot.

     1/4           cup  cilantro

Roast above ingredients in a[n oil-free] cast iron pan, turning occasionally.  Leave husks on tomatillos while you roast 'em.  The husks will be nicely blackened, the skins translucent, and the fruits soft when they're done.  [Let me add: the goal is to blacken the skin while doing the least tomatillo-exploding that you can. That way they don't lose juice into the pan, that burns and smells sometimes. That means moving them around the pan as they roast.]  Put roasted vegetables in food processor with: Salt 1/2 Teaspoon Cilantro 1/4 Cup and process briefly.

 Transfer to a pot, and cook the mixture for 5 minutes.  [This darkens it up a bit, and mellows the flavors.  It tastes too raw otherwise.]  Source: Actually, my husband is the green-salsa preparer, so I sent him e-mail at work, requesting the recipe.

                     Freezing Herbs

The best guide I've seen to freezing, drying, canning, and otherwise preserving all manner of foods is _Stocking Up_ by Carol Hupping:

 In it is excellent advice on freezing fresh herbs for later use.

 Basically, you should blanch the herbs for a few seconds before freezing.

 The Rodale Food Center did some testing, comparing herbs blanched before freezing and those not.  Here were some of the results:

 BASIL: Basil frozen raw darkened to a drab grayish-green and turned somewhat bitter, losing much of its lovely aroma.  But when it was blanched in water before freezing, it stayed green (although darker than when fresh) and was flavorful and aromatic.  Surprisingly, steam blanching was not as successful.

 DILL: The blanched sample was far superior to the raw, frozen one: It was more tender, brighter green, and more flavorful. Instructions for freezing fresh herbs are to:

 1. Wash if visibly dirty 2. Hold by stems with tongs and dip into boiling water briefly, swishing around. Remove when color brightens. 3. Cool by holding under cold running water and blotting dry with towels or let them air cool. 4. Remove stems and either leave whole or chop 5. Lay out flat on waxed paper, roll up or fold paper if you have a small freezer. You want to freeze the herbs so they are not touching each other. 6. Freeze.

 Can be used frozen or thawed in fridge for a week.

 Alternatively, you can freeze herbs into ice cubes.  Remove stems and chop, place in trays, cover with water, and freeze.  You can use pre-blanched herbs or just pour boiling water into the trays over the herbs. These herbed cubes can be used later when you are preparing stoups, just throw a frozen cube or two into the soup.

 The book says that while frozen herbs won't taste or look quite like fresh ones, most will come very close.

       1                onion sliced

       1                zucchini sliced
       3                carrots sliced -- (3 to 4)
       6                mushrooms
       6         small  red potatoes cubed (large)
       1                falafel mix
       1                any seasoning you like (i
                        like cayenne and black
                        pepper)

Start charcoals. Mix the falafel per instructions.  Cut all vegetables.

 When falafel is ready, get a piece of foil big enough to fit all the ingredients.  (You'll know how big after you do your first one!)  Put shiny side in.  (I don't know why, just do it!)  Put some falafel mix in the middle, shape like an oblong pattie.  Put some of each vegetable on top, watch for carrots that like to roll off. :-) Sprinkle lots of seasoning.

 Now the tricky part, closing the foil.  You make a boat and take the long sides, put them together and roll a couple of times (as many as you can). You then take the ends and roll them upwards as far as you can.  I take another piece of foil and wrap it again the same way in the same direction. You want to do it in such a way that no juice or steam can escape.

 Do this until you are out of food.  I made six good sized dinners with falafel and 2 with just vegetables.  I probably used between 1.5 and 2 cups of falafel mix.

 Put foil dinners on coals, making sure there are no flames.  After about 15 minutes, you can flip the dinners.  When you start to smell the food, it probably is done.  You really need to just make sure the vegetables are cooked. You can check a dinner at any time and just close it back up if it's not ready.

 This is a really great dinner.  Serve with bread if you have it.  I like to put picante sauce on mine.

Saute onions and garlic in 1/4 cup of broth until wilted.  Add eggplant and pep per and mix.  Cook for about 5 minutes.  Add the rest of the ingredients and cook c overed until the rice is done (stir occasionally). Remove the bay leaf.  This recipe really holds in the heat so let it cool in the pan for a while.  Enjoy  *Note:  Some types of rice require different water/rice ratios.  Adjust the bro th and rice quantities accordingly.  You may need to add a little more broth or water during the cooking process.  I think the eggplant soaks some of it up.

Heat 1 1/2 cups soy or rice milk, add soy sauce and seasonings. Mix the cornstarch with the remaining milk and add to the pot, stirring constantly. It should thicken quickly. Cook on low heat about few minutes, stirring. It holds well if the rest of dinner isn't quite ready.

 The McDougall recipe puts the cornstarch in 1/4 cup water, but for a gravy you don't need the extra liquid.

FAT-FREE PRODUCTS

The following is a list of Fat-Free grocery items that we like. These are readily available in Milwaukee area grocery stores, and we use most of them a lot.

Heathy Choice Pasta Sauces - Fat free, low salt, and delicious. Definitely saves time over cooking your own sauce.  Having these on hand allows you to make a very quick spaghetti dinner when pressed. Available at almost all area stores (although different stores seem to have different varieties).

Henri's Fat-Free Salad Dressings - No oil, and also no aftertaste. The Honey-Dijon is our favorite.  French and Italian are also very good. Also available in almost all area stores.

Heathy Choice Fat-Free Grated Cheeses - Cheddar and Mozzarella. It tastes ok in recipes that call for cheese, but I don't think I'd try eating it.  Doesn't melt too well.

Old El Paso Fat-Free Refried Beans - Warm these up, put them on Fat-Free Flour Tortillas (also pretty easy to find), add taco sauce and a little fat free cheese, and you have great burritos in a hurry. If you are feeling a little more industrious, cook up some onions, garlic, and peppers, too.

Health Valley Products - Soups, Chili, Crackers. Most Fat-Free or extremely low fat, and very good. Often found in the "diet" sections of grocery stores, or in Health food stores.

Haagen-Daas Chocolate Sorbet - A truly excellent Fat-Free chocolate dessert.

Boca Burgers - Original Recipe is Fat Free.  And they taste amazingly like charcoal-grilled hamburgers (especially if you tend to add ketchup, onions, mustard, relish, etc to your burgers). Available in some pic'n'saves, reliably available at health food stores, like Health Hut in Brookfield. However, at about $4.00 for 4 burgers, We don't plan on having them too much. We are starting to lose our taste for burgers, anyway.

Quaker Oats Rice Cakes - Fat-Free, Low Calorie Snack(and sometimes you HAVE to have a snack).  Lots of flavors.  Our favorite is Caramel Corn.

Mori-Nu Lite Silken Tofu - This took us forever to find. Tofu is great stuff, but relatively high in fat. This stuff is only 1 gram of fat per serving. The only place we have found this is the Health Hut in Brookfield (But its hard to find.  Its up high in the third aisle east.)

Eggo Special K Waffles - Great frozen waffles, fat free. Available almost everywhere.

Pepperidge Farm Fat-Free Brownies - Sometimes, you just HAVE to have a brownie......

                     Fat Substitutes

--------  ------------  --------------------------------

FAT SUBSTITUTES.

One of the big problems for Vegetarian Very Low Fat cooking is how to remove oil and other fats from recipes to adapt them to your new cooking style.  Here are a list of substitutions we collected from a variety of locations.

1.  1 egg You can use 2 egg whites instead of one egg.

2.  3 tablespoons oil (1.2. oz.wt.) You can use 3 tablespoons of applesauce (in baking).

3.  Substitute  Corn Syrup.   (  light )  in any recipe calling for butter.  The result is a much lighter muffin.

4. FAT SUBSTITUTE: > > 6 ounces prunes > 1 cup water > 2 tsp. vanilla

5. I use tofu in baked goods in place of the oil.  It adds moisture & protein without much fat.  There is no taste to speak of and the consistency is a little heavy, but with some experimenting I'm sure you can find the right amount.  My kids (20 & 23) don't even know it's there, and I have a hard time getting them to eat tofu, because it sounds too healthy.

6. substitute in fat free cream cheese for the butter (suggested in a fudge recipe).

7. > While keying in some of my ancient recipes to MasterCook the other day, I >came across this interesting substitution -- a rice puree substitute for >oil in salad dressings.

>It is prepared by cooking 1/2 cup rice in 4 cups water till very soft >(45 minutes, as I recall), then pureeing it in a blender or food processor. >Supposedly, the bland flavor blends well with other dressing ingredients, and >the puree also holds herbs and spices in suspension.  No specific substitution >quantities were given; the author advised experimentation.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1                vegetables
       1                balsamic vinegar
       1                onions
       1                garlic

       1                tomato sauce
       1                broth
       1                corn starch

I saw Paul Prudhomme, the Cajun cook, on a "Home" show this weekend. He said the secret to cooking without fat is to have the non-stick pan *HOT* when you put the vegetables in to start cooking. He recommended the pan be at 350 degrees and he had a special flat, circular thermometer that he lays in the pan to check the temperature.

 Has anyone used one of these thermometers??? How did it work?  Paul's technique for cooking was also very interesting. He started by browning sliced peppers (yellow and red) and carrots in the hot pan. He later added more of the same vegetables so that they would be less cooked and have a different flavor. He said this added to the complexity of flavors in the dish. He also added spices (Cajun of course) at each level of cooking.

 After he cooked the vegetables, he added 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup of tamari and cooked that down. He later added broth, tomato sauce and corn starch... and more spices. I think he also put in onions and garlic at the same time as the vinegar and tamari.

       2          cups  peeled winter squash

       1                apple

       1         Pinch  Grated lemon and orange Peel
                        Nonstick cooking spray (optional)

Cut vegetables and fruit into small pieces.  Mix with cider and spices. Spray ovenproof container with nonstick cooking spray.  Put vegetables and fruit into it and cover.  Bake in 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. Remove cover and add more cider if necessary.  You need enough liquid to keep it from burning, but not too much.  Bake for at least 45 minutes more. The longer you bake it, the more the flavors blend.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours more at 325 degrees.

This comes out so sweet it could be either an accompaniment for a meal or a dessert.

This is a slight modification of a recipe I found in a Blue Cross magazine.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1                onions
       1                leeks
       1                carrots

       1                parsley
       1                peppercorns
       1                fresh or dried herbs (thyme
                        dill -- allspice)
       1                water to cover by two

Cut in big chunks (maybe quarters) a couple onions, leeks, several carrots, some celery ribs and an apple. Toss them with several cloves of garlic, some mushrooms (old, shriveled ones are the best), a few slices of fresh ginger (peel and all), lemon grass is good if you have it and a couple sprays of Pam. Roast all this is 500 degree oven for about 20 minutes until very brown. (This kind of caramelizes them, and they develop a sweetness).

After roasting, put them in a stockpot, and add all the peelings and trimmings you've saved up. plus any veggies you've had around long enough they're beginning to look a little tired. (Or fresh ones, too!) A bunch of parsley is nice, peppercorns, sprigs of dried or fresh herbs (thyme is especially good), maybe some dill seeds, a couple of whole allspices, and enough water to cover everything by 2 inches.

Bring to a boil, simmer for 20-30 minutes (I've let it go a lot longer, too), fish out the veggies, strain, and you have great stock for soup, sauteeing, cooking pasta or rice and whatever else.

The great thing about this, is the recipe really doesn't matter, just the main principles. Use whatever veggies you've got and like (or get rid of some you don't). The roasting and the apple (or pear) seem to be key. The rest is pure invention.

Source: I'm very enthusiastic about vegetable stock. I've been making mt own for several years, now and I think it's great. I got a couple of ideas from the owner of a Seattle restaurant called Dahlia.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1      teaspoon  yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
                        dissolve the yeast in the
                        water
       1           cup  strong coffee
       1      teaspoon  blackstrap molasses
                        (optional) add molasses to
                        the coffee.
       3          cups  whole rye flour
     1/3           cup  whole buckwheat flour
   1 1/4     teaspoons  salt

Mix the dry ingredients.  Add 3/4 cup of the coffee and the yeast solution. If necessary, use the rest of the coffee if the mixture is too dry. Use water on your hands to knead the dough for 5-10 minutes.

Cover and let rest for 2 hours at room temperature.  It won't really rise much.  Again, use water on your hands and knead the dough briefly.  Again cover, and let rise for 30 minutes more, covered with a damp cloth. Shape the dough into 1 or 2 long skinny loaves, again using water on your hands.

Place the dough on a cookie sheet, either greased or dusted with flour. Proof the dough in a warm and humid place (85 deg F.) for about 45 minutes, until the dough is soft.  There will be little rise.  Bake at 450 deg. for 20 minutes, with a pan of water in the oven.  Bake at 375 deg. F. for another 30 minutes, without the water.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      12                potatoes (do not peel)
       1                garlic powder to taste
       1                old bay seasoning (or chili
                        powder) to taste

Scrub the potatoes and cut in half lengthwise.  Put them in a big pot with water to cover and boil.  Cook until done (fork goes in easily), but not falling apart.  Remove the potatoes carefully with a slotted spoon and set them on a cookie sheet or baking pan, cut side up.  Sprinkle liberally with spices. Broil until browned and crusty on the surface.  You could also bake for an hour or so if you don't have a broiler.

I used the lower grade Idaho potatoes for this- they looked like perfect little Idahoes, but were only about 4" long (20 lbs for $1.99, how could I resist?).  Russets would probably work well, too.  I think Yukon Golds and other thin-skinned varieties would tend to fall apart.  Seriously, using the right potatoes for any recipe can matter! Fanatical grin ;)  Source: This is a combination of recipes by Mary McDougal, In the Kitchen with Rosie, and other lister members who took more care.

For the crust, mix together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt.  Gradually add the yogurt and water, then mix until smooth.  Stir the sugar, cayenne, and corn kernels into the batter.  Set aside under a damp cloth.

Preheat the oven to 350 Degrees F.  For the filling, braise the onions, garlic, cumin, chili powder, and coriander in the apple juice concentrate in a large skillet or a heavy pot.  Add the tomato paste, chopped tomato, and diced jalapeno peppers.  Then add the beans, peas, corn, carrots, bell pepper, and parsley.  Braise for about 10 minutes, adding vegetable broth as needed to keep the vegetables from sticking.  Add the salt.  Pour into a 7-1.2" by 12" lasagna pan that is nonstick or coated with vegetable oil spray.

To assemble, spread the batter over the vegetables as evenly as possible.  Bake for about 30 minutes, until the top is bubbling and the crust is just beginning to brown at the edges.

                     Sweet Potato-Parsnip Puree

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3                good sized sweet potatoes
                        equal bulk in parsnips
       1      teaspoon  cumin

Peel sweet potatoes and parsnips, cut into chunks, and cook in water until soft.  A pressure cooker speeds this up.  Drain, puree in food processor. Mix the puree and cumin and put in a casserole dish. Allow to sit for 15 minutes for cumin flavor to develop, mix again, serve.

I subbed the cumin for a T of sesame tahini, which can also be subbed for with a few drops of sesame oil if you can afford it. I believe the cff would stay below 10%.

Oh, and the water from cooking makes a good start on soup the next day.

                     Sweet Potato Whip

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      12                sweet potatoes (pricked all
                        over with a fork)
     1/2           cup  nonfat plain yogurt
       4          cups  defatted chicken broth
                        substitute
   2 1/4        pounds  carrots
                        cinnamon or mace to taste
                        (1/4 tsp)
                        salt and pepper to taste
                        (optional)

Bake the sweet potatoes at 375 for 1.25 hrs or until soft. Let them cool to room temperature.

Cook the carrots in the broth until tender 20 to 25 minutes Reserve 1/2 c of broth.

Scoop out the inside of the cooled potatoes into a large bowl add the carrots, 1/2 c of broth, yogurt and cinnamon.

Mash together and then put 1/2 in a food processor then do the other half. Mix together.

Put in the oven for 15 minutes at 375 before serving.

COMMENTS: The carrots help alleviate the sweetness of the potatoes.

The food processor is not necessary if you have a good potato masher and the  carrots are tender enough.

This was a great dish to prepare the night before.  Except that before serving you would need to put it in the oven for 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1          head  cabbage
       2  large   cans  crushed tomatoes
       1         large  onion
       5        cloves  garlic
                        lemon juice
     1/4                balsamic or wine
                        vinegar
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
       1                ginger
                        salt and pepper

~ slice cabbage thinly to create cabbage strips, - half onion and slice thinly to create half rings - crush, slice or dice garlic - grate ginger  Put everything in a large soup pot and add water to cover plus a little more. Bring to boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 2-3 hours (longer the better).

 Don't be afraid to add more tomato, sugar, or vinegar if you like it more tomatoey, sweeter, or more sour. Taste a couple hours into the cooking for adjustment. The cabbage will have imparted its flavor and the tomatoes will have mellowed.

 You can also add rice during the last 45 - 30 minutes (also add the more water appropriate for the amount of rice you add. For example, I added 3/4 cup brown rice and 1 1/2 cup water the last 40 minutes)  Or add a can of white or garbanzo beans. (Again these won't need cooking, so just add at the end)  [If you're not a vegetarian, you can use b**f or ch*ck*n stock. Even some browned ground m**t or soup bones.]  Posted by nlehrer@isx.com (Nancy Lehrer) to the Fatfree Digest [Volume 14 Issue 15] Jan. 15, 1995.

     1/2           cup  walnuts
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
       2          cups  apple

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, mix first ingredients; the mixture will be thick.  Stir in chopped apple.  Spray a pie pan with no stick spray.  Put mixture in the pan and bake for about 35 minutes.

I never use the nuts and it still tastes great.  I never use more than one cup on sugar - depends on the sweetness of the apples I use.  I especially like to use Fuji apples.  Before baking I sprinkle the top of the batter with a touch of cinnamon sugar.  We enjoy this warm but it is ok cold too!

Boil lentils (salt to taste). Put vegetable cube in and boil for 15 minutes. At the same time, saute the onion. When brown add carrot, celery and cook by moving the mix with a spoon (I use a wooden spoon). Add red lentils, bread crumbs and incorporate with vegetables. At this point is a good idea to test for taste with salt, pepper and cumin. At the end, add coriander, mix and put aside.

Cut the top of tomatoes and remove core, ( I save it to use as a sandwich spread), drain juice and fill them with stuffing. Bake for 45 min on Low. Bon apetit!!!  Posted by "Paul Carreno" <PCARRENO@acserv.ad.cowan.edu.au> to the Fatfree Digest [Volume 15 Issue 30] Mar 2, 1995.

     1/4        medium  red bell pepper -- finely
                        diced (I'd use more next
                        time )
       2                scallions -- finely chopped
                        (both white and green parts
                        reserve 1*teaspoon
                        for dipping sauce)
       1                minced garlic clove (reserve
     1/8                for dipping
                        sauce)
                        marinated mushrooms from
                        above recipe
     1/4           cup  whole water chestnuts
                        finely diced
       1    tablespoon  hoisin sauce
       1    tablespoon  all-purpose flour
                        bun dough (see above
                        recipe)
       3   tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
       1      teaspoon  white vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  hot chili oil
                        chopped cilantro for
                        garnish

In large non-stick saucepan, add bell pepper, scallions, and garlic, and cook, stirring constantly, until peppers are soft, 5-8 minutes. Chop mushrooms (the pieces need to be fairly small to go in the dumplings) and add, with marinade, to peppers. Add water chestnuts and hoisin sauce; cook until most of liquid has evaporated, 3-4 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Sprinkle work surface with flour. Turn bun dough out onto prepared surface, knead 1 minute and roll into a log, about 16" long and 1 1/2" wide. Cut dough into 16 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Flatten each ball with the palm of your hand into a 3" diameter circle. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling mixture in center of each dough round, and gather up edges to enclose filling, twisting edges together and pressing to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling, covering buns with plastic wrap.

 WARNING: This takes a little practice, so I'd recommend that you plan on *not* serving the first 2 or 3 you make to company. =-)  Line steamer rack with cheesecloth or wax paper (I used cabbage leaves). Place in large shallow saucepan or wok; add 2" water, cover and bring to rolling boil. Arrange 8 of the buns at least 1" apart on prepared steamer rack; cover and steam until puffy, tender and cooked through, 15-20 minutes. Repeat with remaining buns, adding water to pan as necessary. (I did this in my Black and Decker steamer, which only allowed for 4 dumplings at a time. I filled the water to the highest water mark, refilling after steaming 8 dumplings.)  Meanwhile, prepare dipping sauce: In small bowl, combine soy sauce, 1 tablespoon water, the reserved scallions, the vinegar, the reserved garlic, and the hot chili oil, if using; sprinkle with cilantro, if using.

Serve freshly steamed buns immediately, with dipping sauce on the side, or cool and freeze for later use. (To reheat, thaw until soft and steam until warmed through, 5 minutes.)  Enjoy! The recipe also says that you can use other veggies and sauces -- try chopping up your favorite ff chinese dish and making it into a filling!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         whole  pita bread -- (2 to 3)
       1     10 oz pkg  frozen spinach
     1/3           cup  nutritional yeast
       1        medium  onion
       5                plum tomatoes -- (5 to 6)
       1  8 ounces pkg  fresh mushrooms
       3        cloves  garlic -- (3 to 4)
       1      teaspoon  the following
                        spices: basil, parsley
                        cayenne pepper
     1/2           cup  rice milk -- (1/2 to 1)
       4   tablespoons  flour

Thaw spinach completely, press out all water.  Heat milk in saucepan, when hot but not boiling stir in flour.  Stir until sauce begins to thicken, turn heat down. Add nutritional yeast and spinach. Stir constantly until thick and gooey, only about 3-4 min.

 In separate pan, saute onion, garlic, until onion is tender.  Stir in tomatoes, mushrooms, and spices.  Saute until just done.  Preheat oven to 425.  Using a very sharp bread knife, split each pita bread so that you have two round flat pieces instead of one thick one. Place each piece of bread on a cookie sheet or pizza pan. Spread spinach sauce over each. Top with tomato mixture, being careful to avoid the juice. Bake for 5 to 7 min.

 Watch closely so that the edges of the pita don't burn.  Makes a nice crunchy crust.  This made enough for 5 individual pizzas.  Sorry, I don't have nutritional info.

Cook the wheat berries in 2.5 cups of water (it will take about an hour). Combine the remaining ingredients and simmer while the wheat berries are cooking.   Add the wheat berries when they are done and enjoy!  If the wheat berries do not absorb all the water, drain them before adding to the chili.  They should be a little chewy.  I didn't measure the cinnamon or chili powder; the measurements should be close though. The pinto beans were fresh.

If chilis are not hot enough, puree in blender or chopper 1 or 2 jalepanos and add. Then add tabasco to taste.

I am drooling thinking about the leftovers in the fridge. I can't wait to make and eat more.

Bake eggplant on a baking sheet at 400 degrees for about 8-10 minutes. When I turned the slices over and topped them with basil and sliced tomato like the recipe said, I brushed them with a mixture of low-sodium tamari and balsamic vinegar. I added some pieces of red pepper at this time, too, and brushed them with the mixture. Eight minutes or so more in the oven, and it was YUMMY!

       1         large  sweet onion
       2   tablespoons  herb vinegar (or whatever

     1/2      teaspoon  citric acid (optional -- for
                        longer shelf life)

1. Saute Onion along with the spices in a small amount of veggie broth, wine, or water until transparent and tender. 

2. Put tomatoes and onion mixture in blender, add vinegar and sugar. Blend on low speed. 

3. Taste, add more vinegar, salt,  and/or more sugar to suit individual taste buds.

This makes a nice dressing for any kind of green salad.

Thanks for the prodding to get this done.  It's something I've been wanting to do since selling the stuff last summer.

       1          part  arborio rice

                        whatever you like to use for
                        sauteing

Saute the rice over a medium to high heat until translucent. Add one half a cup or so of the stock and stir.  Reduce heat to somewhere between medium and low.  The stock will absorb into the rice. When absorbed, add another half cup or so of stock and continue stirring. keep stirring and adding stock. The whole process takes twenty to thirty minutes.

I usually throw in a cup of frozen veggies when the rice is almost done (corn and peas are good) for texture.  My boss adds mushrooms. Also good. (If you eat dairy, a little bit of high quality parm or romano sprinkled on before serving is really good but not a necessity.)  Posted by "Lisa E.

       3     teaspoons  canned chopped garlic
                        (polaner brand is packed in
                        water)
                        (or 1*tsp garlic powder)
       1      teaspoon  black pepper
       2     teaspoons  dehydrated onion flakes
                        -----seasoning option 2-----
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
       2     teaspoons  italian seasoning
                        -----seasoning option 3-----
     1/4           cup  bottled italian or
                        vinaigrette dressing
                        (and drain the corn more
                        thoroughly)

Rip up the spinach a bit, if it's in huge stringy clumps. Toss everything together in a bowl.  Let sit for a few minutes if you've got dry spices in there.  Heat up if you feel like it, else eat cold.

I'd like to try this with chopped red bell pepper in it - I think it would taste good, and I know it would look good...

It would also taste good with kidney or black beans, but the darker liquid from the beans would make the dish look muddy.  Most of my veggie cooking looks brown (or red) and boring - it's a nice change to eat something bright and pretty...

Actually, I usually make this with frozen corn...  but I don't measure that, I just pour it from the bag...

                     Potatoes With Fenugreek Leaves

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4        medium  sized potatoes -- (4 to 5)
                        any type of potato other
                        than the baking ones will
                        do
       1            bn  fenugreek greens or a small
       1            bn  spinach+dried fenugreek
                        leaves
                        few mustard seeds
       1         pinch  asafoetida (optional -- but it
                        really adds to the flavor
                        here)

x  Cayenne/Chili powder 1    Pinch turmeric Salt 1 sm Pinch of sugar Your favorite liquid for Sauteeing(water or vegetable Broth)  Boil and cube the potatoes. Wash the greens, shred into fine strands and set  aside. Heat a good non-stick pan and add the mustard seeds. As soon as they  start spluttering, add the asafetida, fry for a couple of seconds and then ad  the cayenne/chili powder and turmeric and continue sauteeing adding a bit of  liquid if it sticks. If dried fenugreek leaves are used, crush them a bit  and add at this point. Add the cubed potatoes, salt and sugar and reduce the  flame to medium. Saute potatoes without adding any more liquid till a nice  crust forms around them. Now start adding the shredded greens, a little at a  time. Continue sauteeing till all the liquid is absorbed and the greens are a wilted. Serve with chapatis(the types that are roasted on an open flame, call d phulkas) or with steamed rice and dhal.

 > (For those who are wondering, fenugreek has a 'spicy' taste most > similar to the effect of cumin - it makes the food spicier without > adding a particular taste of its own.  *Not* spicy as in capsicum... > just a vague idea that the food is spicy.  (How *do* you describe the > taste of a new food???))  Well, it is not very spicy as long as you use small quantities of fenugreek. You will be surprised at how strongly bitter the spice is if you use it in larger amounts. I could post my recipe for curry powder using fenugreek if anybody wants it, I generally use this powder to make a spicy lentil stew called 'sambhar'.

                     Pizza Dough

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1      teaspoon  active dry yeast (i am going
                        to try a whole pack = 2.5
       1           tsp  -- to see if
                        it's more bready)
   1 2/3             c  unbleached or -- (1 2/3 to 2)
                        all-purpose flour
       1           cup  cake flour
       1      teaspoon  salt

In a measuring cup or small bowl, sprinkle yeast over 1/4 cup warm water; stir until dissolved. In a mixing bowl, combine 1 2/3 cups of the unbleached or all-purpose flour, cake flour, and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture. With a wooden spoon, gradually stir in the flour, adding 3/4 C warm water as you mix. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until very smooth, soft, and no longer sticky, about 10 minutes, adding additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking. (The dough should still be quite wet, however.)  Set the dough in [a bowl sprayed lightly with cooking spray] and turn to coat lightly. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

 About 10 minutes before baking pizza, turn the dough onto the floured board, punch it down and knead briefly. Use a pastry cutter or a thin, sharp knife to divide the dough in half. (If you pull the dough apart, you risk tearing the gluten strands.) Pat each half into a ball and flatten into a disk.

 ADD TOPPINGS! =-)  The dough can be made ahead, enclosed in a plastic bag, and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Defrost for at least 8 hours in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before using.)  582 calories per pizza crust, 16 g protein, 1 g fat, 123 g carbohydrate, 1,070 mg sodium, 0 mg cholesterol (counts for white flour.)  What I put on this pizza:

 A tomato sauce with oregano and garlic and a pinch of sugar, roasted onions, roasted peppers, roasted garlic, plumped sun dried tomatoes, shitake mushrooms.

 I also made a "turnover/calzone" type thing by placing a bean mixture (black beans, garlic, onion, salsa, roasted red peppers -- next time I want to add ff soy cheese) and baking for about 20 minutes at 350. I made the apple turnovers by taking 1/8th of the dough, rolling it thin, placing chopped apples on one half (about 1 1/2 small apples). The apples had been mixed with some cinnamon and a pinch of brown sugar. Cook both of these items on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil because they run all over the place.

       1         pound  red onions
                        water -- boiling
       1           cup  vinegar

       1         clove  garlic -- sliced

Peel the onion and slice into thin rounds.  Separate the rounds and put them in a colander large enough to hold them comfortably.  Put the colander in the sink.

Bring about a quart of water to a boil, and  pour it over the onions, letting it drip right through the colander.  Transfer the onions to a bowl and add the vinegar, cold water, spices, sugar, and garlic.  If the onions aren't covered by the liquid, add more as necessary, using equal parts water and vinegar.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool, and the color is diffused, about 30 minutes.  Keep in the liquid, refrigerated, and use as needed.

     1/2         pound  mushrooms
       4        cloves  garlic -- (4 to 5)
       1                some dry sherry
       1           tin  skim evaporated milk
                        (less than 3 g fat per tin)
       1                red pepper
       1                green pepper
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1                black pepper

Chop the onion, garlic, and mushroom.  Saute over high heat in enough sherry to keep it wet for about 10 minutes.  Put the pasta water on to boil.

 Reduce the heat under the veggies and add the tin of milk.  Put the pasta in the boiling water.  Simmer the sauce over low heat while the pasta cooks.  Chop up the red and green peppers and add them to the simmering sauce.  Add salt & black pepper to taste.  Let simmer for about 5 minutes, which should be enough time to cook the pasta.

 Drain the pasta, pour the sauce over the pasta, and serve.  Sprinkle with a bit of Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast, and more black pepper, to taste.

 Variations:  obviously, vary the vegetable content.  Sun dried tomatoes are one of my favourite candidates.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1          part  mixed whole grains
                        (e g. wheat berries, oats
                        buckwheat, hulled barley
                        rye, millet -- etc.)
       3         parts  water
     1/3          part  raisins (optional)

Boil water Add grains [and raisins, if using them] Stir Bring to boil again Turn off heat Cover pot Leave overnight as is [or in a warm oven]  (NOTE: I usually add raisins to already cooked cereal because I like the texture. They turn out differently if they are added in the cooking stage. They plump up and are really soft, which is nice sometimes. I guess other types of dried fruit might work too.)  You can reheat this in the morning or eat it at room temp. Suggested toppings included any of the following:

 milk-type stuff molasses fruit sesame salt maple syrup  One variation the cookbook suggests is toasting and then grinding the grains in a hand grinder before cooking. Apparently, this makes the grains more nutty tasting.

                     Orzo And Portobello Mushrooms

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2                portobello mushrooms
       1           cup  (before cooking) orzo
       4        ounces  app sundried tomatoes
       4        cloves  minced garlic (or to
                        taste)
       2   tablespoons  capers (or to taste)
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme, marjoram -- and
                        oregano
       1           cup  white wine
       1                salt and crushed red pepper
                        to taste

you can make this in under 30 minutes if you do it all at once. so put the water on to boil for the orzo, and put the sundried tomatoes in a bowl with about a cup of water to reconstitute (rinse them off first as you will use the soaking water later). wash the portobellos and cut off the stems. put caps in a dish and sprinkle with the three herbs, then pour the cup of wine over them to marinate. coarsely chop the mushroom stems, mince the garlic. in a nonstick pan, saute the garlic and mushroom stems in a little tomato water or wine. drain tomatoes, reserving the liquid, and chop coarsely (it's okay if they are not fully softened at this point) and saute. the water should be boiling now so put the orzo on to cook. scoot the tomato/garlic/chopped mushroom mixture to the edges of the pan and place mushroom caps in the middle. pour the tomato water over them, cover, and simmer until the mushrooms are finished, about 12 minutes (same time as it takes the orzo to cook--hey!). remove the mushroom caps to a plate (to two plates I mean) and pour the leftover marinating wine into the pan, and add capers. cook and stir until reduced. drain orzo and toss with the mixture, and serve with the mushroom caps. yum! (I was bad and garnished this with toasted pine nuts and it was great, but I am eating nutless leftovers now and it is still really good). sorry my recipes are always so rambling.

   1 1/2          cups  whole wheat flour

Dissolve soda in molasses, add sour milk and mix well.  Mix in bran and raisins.  Gradually fold in flour; turn into an 8x4x2 inch loaf pan greased or lined with wax paper, and spread evenly.  Bake 45 minutes in a moderate oven (350 deg. F)  My variations: I substitute 3/4 cup skim milk + 3/4 cup skim yogurt for the buttermilk.  I substitute 1 1/2 cups oatmeal for the bran.  Last time I made this, I also added 2 grated carrots, and had nice carrot cake. I also plump the raisins in the microwave with some water.

       1                matzo meal or bread crumbs
       1                egg white or binder

The technique of making potato cakes is a great one!  I often steam potatoes along with carrots and turnips or rutabagas or winter squash, and then mash them all together with a little heated rice milk. We call it "mishmash." My mother made us this dish (with ground b**f) when we were convalescing, because it was easy to eat. It's great with ketchup. Leftovers make wonderful cakes, mixed with matzo meal or bread crumbs, and even egg white if you need a binder. It's also easy to reheat in the microwave.

Cook pasta shells.  While cooking pasta heat a large skillet with the water and vinegar. When getting hot add the cubed eggplant, onion, chives, garlic, green peppers, and mushrooms. Saute till soft (I sauteed at fairly high heat for about 15-20 minutes stirring a lot. I like eggplant to be pretty).  When done add to the pasta along with the tomato sauce, oregano, salt, pepper and red wine. stir and heat gently (on low). This was actually fairly easy to make, the only time consuming part was peeling the eggplant and chopping veggies.

Here's a method for de-gassing dried beans that seems to work.  It's from the new book Fat Free, Flavor Full by Dr. Gabe Mirkin and Diana Rich.

 "Put the beans in a large pot and cover them with water.  Bring them to a boil and take them off the heat.  This breaks the capsules surrounding the beans and allows stachyose, verbascose and raffinose, the gas-causing sugars, to escape into the water.  Stir a couple of tablespoons of baking soda into the water and let the beans soak overnight. Drain the soaking water off the beans and rinse them several times. (If you eat the soaking liquid, you will cause unbelievable discomfort for yourself and those around you.)"  Then you cook 'em and eat 'em. End of story, so to speak. I've used this method with pinto beans, but rarely soak them for more than 4 hours (because when I'm hungry for beans I want them today, not tomorrow).  I've found it better than Beano, but of course your mileage may vary.

Form into patties ( make sure they are thin) and fry in a non-stick pan. I found that mine took quite a while to cook (too thick) but they turned out very good!  Passed the taste test, my 8 year old just loved them.

       3                pre-frozen cubes of reduced
                        stock or 3*t vegetable
                        stock
       4   tablespoons  unbleached flour
       1         slice  onion or 1*t chopped
                        shallots
       2          cups  nonfat milk
     1/3           cup  dry nonfat milk
       1                bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme -- crushed

Heat stock in nonstick saucepan over medium heat.  Add flour and onion; blend with a wooden spoon or whisk.

 Simmer over low heat for several minutes, stirring constantly.  Do not allow to brown.

 Remove from heat, add milks, bay leaf, thyme, white pepper, and vegetable seasoning.  Return to heat, stirring constantly until mixture coats the spoon.  If desired, add wine and simmer 5 minutes more to evaporate alcohol. [ahem .... this won't really get rid of all the alcohol -mrd]  Remove onion and bay leaf.

 Cover and store until used, or place in an airtight container and refrigerate for several days, or freeze for future use.

 Serving Suggestions: This sauce be used over 8 cups of steamed vegetables such as broccoli florets, diced potatoes, quartered mushrooms, peas, asparagus, or sliced carrots.  To serve, place vegetables in a shallow ovenproof serving dish.  Drizzle sauce over vegetables, sprinkle with 2 T Sap Sago cheese or with Hungarian paprika and place under broiler to brown lightly before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2          cups  cooked broccoli stems -- tough
                        outer layers peeled off
   1 1/2   tablespoons  fresh-squeezed lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2                tomato -- diced
       1                scallion -- sliced
       1                canned green chili -- chopped

In a food processor, blend the broccoli stems with the lemon juice, cumin, and garlic powder until completely smooth.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix well by hand, but do not blend.  Chill before serving for best flavor.

 Note:the above was copied directly from the book.  I doubled the recipe. I also used a fresh green chili instead of canned, which I don't think I can get over here.  It was very tasty, but do not expect it to taste like avocado.  Think of it as a really good broccoli dip, and not necessarily as a replacement for something else. Everyone at my party the other night enjoyed it.

                     Breakfast Hash Purples

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1                purple potatoes
       1                green onions (amount
                        according to taste)
       1                garlic (amount according to
                        taste)
       1                red peppers (amount
                        according to taste)
       1                salt
       1                pepper
       1                cayenne pepper powder or
                        paprika (depending on heat
                        desired)

Soak the purple potatoes in a bowl of water for about a half an hour.  This makes it very easy to scrub the skins, eliminating the need to peel them and lose those  nutrients.  After scrubbing, pat them dry and cut them into approximately 3/4" cubes. Be careful where you cut them, as they can stain (purple potato juice!). Put them in a mixing bowl. Wash, trim, and slice the green onions. Add to potatoes. Finely chop the garlic and add to potatoes. Wash and cut up the red peppers to taste. I like fairly large hunks of sweet red pepper. Add salt, pepper, and pepper powder to taste.

 Spray a little bit of Pam or other cooking spray in a non-stick roasting pan. Bake in a 400-degree oven for approximately 1/2 hour. This time will vary with the size and amount of the potato pieces. Stir occasionally while baking. I have found that ensuring that they lie in a single layer works the best and yields a crispy, not soggy, crust on the potatoes.

 Sorry about the approximate amounts.  I make this different every time.  We find that the combination of purple, green, red, and white makes a dish that is a visual delight.  It's also a low fat replacement for those greasy breakfast hash browns.

                        -----mix well-----
       1           cup  white wave soy yogurt
       1           cup  applesauce (unsweetened)
       2            c.  turbinado sugar -- (2 to 3)
       2     teaspoons  vanilla
       1           cup  rolled oats (whole)
       2          cups  rolled oats (process in food

   1 1/2   tablespoons  baking soda
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2   tablespoons  ener-g egg replacer

Combine mixtures.  The baking soda should react somewhat, making the mass fluffy and easy to stir.  Add more flour until a cookie dough texture is reached (I had to use ~ 2.75 c. total).

 Add chips or fruit or whatever.  Shape into balls and bake at 375 until browned.  They do brown, they don't melt around the edges in that weird way that bad cookies do, and were considered entirely successful.

Put non-stick stuff on pans and immediately pour in the batter, approximately three-fourths of the way up.  Bake for 25 minutes, or until the cornbread is brown around the edges and firm.  Cut each cornbread into 4 wedges.

Place all of the ingredients in a food processor or blender. Process until smooth.

 Note: I copied the above.  I used fresh green chilies, dry cilantro from a jar ( a little less than 1/4 cup), lemon juice instead of lime, and no pepper.  EVERYONE loved the dressing.

 Enjoy.  And I definitely recommend the New Mcdougall cookbook. The recipes are not complicated and there is something for everyone.

Saute the chopped veggies (all but zucchini) in about 1/2 cup water until the onions are translucent.  Add everything else and bring to boil. Lower heat to simmer and add 4 cups of cooked or canned kidney beans. (oops, I forgot the beans in the ingredient list above) Simmer for about an hour, or longer.  Even better if it sits another day. Freezes well. Good over rice.

       2                garlic
   1 1/2     teaspoons  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  gcinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ginger
       1                green bell pepper -- diced 1/4"
       1           cup  zucchini -- cubed
       2          cups  tomatoes, canned
       2   tablespoons  raisins
       2   tablespoons  parsley -- chopped
       2   tablespoons  cilantro -- chopped
       1           cup  peas, frozen
       8            oz  couscous

Sort and rinse the chickpeas, then soak overnight in water. Drain and cook in 5 cups water until tender, about 2 to 3 hours.  Drain, reserving the broth, and set aside.

Warm a cup of the check-pea broth in a skillet or sup pot and add the onion, garlic, and the dried spices.  Simmer gently until the onions have begun to soften, about 7 minutes.  Don't let the pan dry out or the spices will burn.  Add more liquid as needed.

Once the onions are soft, add the chickpeas, pepper, squash, the juice from the tomatoes, and the chopped tomatoes, the raisins, the parsley and cilantro.  Add enough chick-pea broth or water to cover, bring to a boil, then simmer until the vegetables are done and the liquid has reduced, making a nice sauce. Add the green peas during the last 5 minutes.

Make the couscous and serve with the vegetables and their sauce.  Garnish with cilantro or parsley.

x  Stock or sherry for Sauteeing 1 tb Tomato paste, mixed with 3 Tb water 1    15 oz can chick peas, Drained 1    Medium-large potato, peeled And diced 1/2 c  Water 1/2 ts Salt 1    To 2 fresh green chillies, Chopped 1/2 ts Ground cumin x  Few drops lemon juice x  Cayenne pepper, if you like It hot....

 Saute the cumin seeds and garlic in stock or sherry for 2 mins, then add the diluted tomato paste and cook for 1 minute longer. Then add the chick peas, water, potato, salt, green chillies, ground cumin, and lemon juice. I find that one green chilli makes this pleasantly spicy, but if you like it hot, add cayenne pepper or chili powder at this stage. Simmer for 20 mins. Serve with bread; I like pita bread, but crusty bread or tortillas work just as well.

 Adapted from Madhur Jaffrey's _Eastern Vegetarian Cooking_. These quantities serve two, but you can easily double or quadruple them.

                     Brain-Dead Food: Curry Rice & Spinach

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           box  near east curry rice
       1           box  frozen spinach
       1           can  black beans
       1           can  diced tomatoes (slightly
                        drained)

I might have posted this before, but one of my favorite brain-dead foods (outside of spaghetti), is to take one box of Near-East Curry Rice and cook according to directions, without the added fat.  While that is cooking, microwave 1 frozen block of spinach (for some reason fresh spinach doesn't taste as good to me in this recipe -- and takes longer unless already de-stemmed and washed).  When that is done, drain and set aside. Nuke 1 can of black beans, drained and rinsed, and 1 can of diced tomatoes (minus some of the juice), mixed together (generally for about 3 minutes).

When rice is done, mix spinach, rice, beans and tomatoes (generally in a large bowl).  Snarf.   Not only does it taste good, but it's really colorful with the yellow rice, black beans, red tomatoes and green spinach. Very satisfying.  Even my almost-3-yr-old loves it.

Approximate total time: 25-30 minutes (time to cook rice)  Source: apparent original  Posted by mvklj@mvgpl.att.com (Karen L J Carr +1 508 960 6346) to the Fatfree Digest [Volume 16 Issue 5] Mar. 9, 1995.

Chop up the Canadian Bacon slices into bite size pieces.

Heat apple juice in nonstick skillet.  Add enough potatoes to more or less form one layer.  Sprinkle the chopped up canadian bacon on top.  Stir/turn over a couple of times, several minutes apart, to prevent excess sticking (I like crisp potatoes so I let it stick a bit).

While potatoes are cooking, mix up gravy mix (I was so brain damaged I just microwaved some leftover gravy that I found in the fridge :-), pour over potatoes to taste and eat.

Some good bread to sop up the gravy would be a plus.  Next time I'll add some other frozen veggies.

       1           can  (15 oz.) black beans
       1   small   can  sliced water chestnuts
                        (8oz )

   4 1/2          cups  flour
       2      packages  active dry yeast
   1 1/2          cups  warm water -- 110-115 F
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       1    tablespoon  salt
       1    tablespoon  sugar

 Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can mix in with a spoon. Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead in enough remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough. Continue kneading until smooth and elastic, 6 - 8 minutes. Cover; let dough rest 10-15 minutes.

 Cut into 12 portions; shape into smooth balls. Punch a hole in the center of each with a floured finger. Pull gently to enlarge hole to 1 1/2 to 2 inches. Place on a greased baking sheet. Cover; let rise 20 minutes. Broil 5 inches from heat for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes on each side. Tops should not brown.

 Heat 1 gallon water and 1 tablespoon sugar to boiling; reduce heat. Cook bagels, 4 or 5 at a time, for 7 minutes, turning once. Drain. Place on greased baking sheet. Bake in 375 degree oven 25 - 30 minutes.

Check the state of origin on the bag to see if you have Michigan boilers or an off brand Idaho baker. For boiling, I like Michigan (plain old brown potatoes), red (thin skinned), and Yukon Golds - and those lovely new red potatoes in the spring!  For baking, Idaho or russets.  For mashing, russets. I know there are lots of neat varieties out there that I haven't seen, please let us all know about them!

                        (usually 1/8 cup
       1         quart  buttermilk

Mix all the dry ingredients in a LARGE bowl. Mix in caraway and raisins. Mix in buttermilk. It helps to use your hands to mix this because the dough is sticky DO NOT USE AN ELECTRIC MIXER. I did this a couple of times and the bread came out very flat. Divide batter into two buttered cake pans. Flour a knife and cut a cross into the tops of each. Bake at 350 for about an hour. The top should not be allowed to get to brown.

Although slightly bland, it's a good filler, and well, you can see from the ingredients that you probably will loose weight if you ate nothing but this {godawful my mother calls it} soup.

When first side is golden brown, turn once and cook until it is a nice brown and crispy on both sides. Makes a good vegetarian bacon for BLT sandwich or other purpose.

       3    tablespoon  unsalted butter
       4         ounce  shiitake mushrooms
                        (or other wild mushrooms)

                        salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
       2    tablespoon  unsalted butter
       1    tablespoon  oil
     1/3           cup  finely minced onion
   1 1/2           cup  arborio rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine or broth
       5           cup  broth
     1/4           cup  mascarpone cheese
                        =or=- whipping cream
                        (or substitute skim milk)
     1/4           cup  grated parmesan cheese
       1    tablespoon  chopped parsley

You can substitute dried wild mushrooms for the shiitake. Just soak them for 15-to-20 minutes beforehand (and be sure to add the strained soaking liquid to the stock).

 HEAT BUTTER in small skillet over moderate heat. When it begins to foam, add mushrooms and cook for 3-to-5 minutes, until soft. Add salt and pepper to taste. Turn off heat and set aside. Bring the broth to a steady simmer in a saucepan on top of the stove. Heat butter and oil in heavy 4-quart casserole over moderate heat. Add onion, saute for 1-to-2 minutes, until it begins to soften, being careful not to brown. Add rice to butter-oil-onion mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir 1 minute, making sure all grains are well coated. Add wine and stir until completely absorbed. Add simmering broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until each addition is almost completely absorbed (approximately 2 minutes) before adding next 1/2 cup, reserving 1/4 cup to add at the end. Stir often. After approximately 18 minutes (rice should be tender and firm), add 1/4 cup broth, mushrooms, Mascarpone and Parmesan cheeses and stir vigorously so cheeses melt. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately.

Meanwhile, medium heat a large skillet or a heavy cook-pot. Add oil saute' garlic and onion; add chili powder, add cumin. Add tofu mixture to seasoned onions in the pot, and mix well.

     1/2      teaspoon  tumeric

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet.  Add garlic, onion, pepper, carrot & celery.  Season with 1 tablespoon tamari.  When vegetables are tender, remove from the heat & place in a large bowl.

 Add mashed tofu.  Cut bread into crouton sized pieces & quick fry in oil with tamari, garlic powder & five tablespoons of nutritional yeast.  Add to tofu mixture.

 Season with remaining ingredients.  Combine well & place the batter into a well greased casserole.

 Bake at 350F for 35 minutes.

 Allow to cool for 5 minutes or so, slide a butter knife around the edges, turn upside down on a plate.  Serve warm with a simple green salad.  It is also terrific in sandwiches cold.  It keeps pretty well in the fridge for several days.

 Serves 4 to 6.

 *When using this amount of nutritional yeast, be sure to use a good quality product.  I speak here from experience.  Something like angevita is disgusting when used in large quantities.  Apart from that, enjoy-  Posted by Mark Satterly in Fidonet Intercook

Rub the salt into the leaves by taking them up, a bunch at a time, and rubbing them between your hands; the volume of spinach will decrease drastically as you do. Tear the spinach up as you do this. Rinse the salt off thoroughly and dry the spinach, squeezing it in bunches in a towel.  (If using frozen spinach, just let it thaw and squeeze out the excess moisture.)

                        and roughly chopped
       2    tablespoon  parmesan or romano cheese
                        (grated)
       2         whole  eggs -- plus
       2                egg yolks
   1 1/2           cup  light cream
       1           cup  provolone cheese -- grated
      20                black nicoise olives -- pitted

PREPARE THE TART DOUGH. If you are using unyeasted crust, partially prebake it. Halve the peppers lengthwise, remove the seeds and veins, then halve them crosswise and slice very thinly. Warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a wide pan, add the peppers, onion, half the garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Saute over medium-high heat for several minutes, then lower the heat, add the water or white wine, cover and stew until the peppers and onion are very soft and sweet. If the peppers and onion threaten to stick as the sugars are released, add additional small amounts of water or wine. Taste for salt, and season with freshly ground black pepper when the peppers and onion are finished cooking. Put 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a blender jar with the remaining garlic and a few of the basil leaves and puree. Gradually add the rest of the basil leaves, using more oil if necessary. Scrape the puree out of the jar, stir in the Parmesan or Romano cheese and season with salt. If using the yeasted tart dough, prepare the shell, then make the custard. Beat the eggs and yolks together, then add the cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 400F. Paint the crust with the basil puree, then lay half the grated Provolone cheese on top, followed by the peppers and onion, and the olives. Add the remaining cheese, then the custard. Bake the tart in the center of the oven until it is golden brown, and set, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the tart rest 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

                     Pasta With Vegetables

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6         ounce  pasta, non-egg -- your choice
                        (i like rotelle for this)
       1                yellow onion -- largish
       1                green bell pepper
       6                mushrooms -- medium
       1                zucchini squash
       1           can  hunt's "light" fat-free
                        spaghetti sauce (26.75 oz)
       1                weight watcher's brand
                        fat-free "grated parmesan
                        italian topping"

Start a pot of water on high for the pasta, and put a large non-stick skillet on medium high heat (no added lubrication.)  When the water boils, dump the pasta in and look at the clock.

 Meanwhile, wash and cut up the veggies in the sequence given, dumping each into the skillet and stirring before going on to the next.  The key to this recipe is to cut the vegetables into large enough chunks, and not to overcook them.  Cut onion into quarters, then slice about 3/4 inch thick. Likewise for the pepper, removing stem, seeds, and soft parts. Cut mushrooms in half, or quarters if larger.  Cut the zuke in half lengthwise, then slice 1/2 inch thick.

 When the pasta has boiled for 10 to 12 minutes, take it off and drain it. Check that the veggies are not still raw, then pour the can of sauce in with them.  Divide the pasta onto serving plates while the sauce is heating. Stir the sauce, and when it's hot through, spoon over the pasta. Top generously to taste with the phony parmesan.

 Makes 2 large or 3 smaller servings.  Elapsed time under 20 minutes. Zero grams fat.

                        taleggio -- bel paese
                        or fresh mozzarella -- sliced

SLOWLY MELT BUTTER IN HEAVY PAN over low heat with 4 fresh sage leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried, and the sliced garlic. When garlic is golden brown, remove it, but continue to cook butter until light amber with a distinctly nutty aroma. Scoop foam off top as it rises so that you can see the color, then pour it through strainer lined with layer of cheesecloth. Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to boil. Add 1 tablespoon salt and potatoes. Cook 5 to 8 minutes or until potatoes are fairly tender, but just short of being done. Rinse them immediately with cool water and set them in colander to drain, but reserve cooking water for pasta. Chop or crumble remaining sage leaves. Heat half the brown butter in wide saute pan, add leeks, sage, half the minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium-low heat until leeks are soft. Add cabbage, 1 teaspoon salt and a little water. It might be necessary to add cabbage in stages, letting some of it cook down before adding rest. Cover pan and simmer until cabbage is cooked. dd Parmesan cheese and season with plenty of freshly ground black pepper and salt, if needed, to make flavors bright and strong. Return reserved cooking water to boil, add pasta and partially cook it, leaving it a little chewier than you would want to eat. Drain in colander, return it to empty pan and toss with rest of butter, remaining minced garlic and potatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Butter casserole and layer half the noodles, half the cabbage and most of sliced cheese. Shake casserole so that vegetables and cheese can slip in among noodles. Add rest of pasta and cheese and finish with layer of cabbage. At this point, dish can be refrigerated until ready to bake. Bake at 425F about 20 minutes or until hot throughout and cheese is melted. If casserole is cold when placed in oven, bake it covered 15 minutes, then remove cover and continue baking until heated through. Serve from baking dish.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      16        ounces  tomato sauce, unsalted -- can
       4          cups  -- water
       1        medium  onion -- chopped
       5                garlic cloves -- minced
       2        ounces  chili powder

     1/4      teaspoon  cumin -- ground
                        corn meal -- as needed

Place the tomato sauce and 4 cups of water in a deep 6 to 8 quart pot. Add onion and garlic. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Add chili powder, cayenne, oregano, and paprika, stirring well. Add texturized vegetable protein, stir well, simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in cumin, and water if needed for the desired consistency, and cook for 5 more minutes. If additional thickness is desired, stir in 1 tablespoon or masa (corn flour) or corn meal into the chili. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes after adding the masa. Serve this chili over cooked pinto or kidney beans if desired. It may also be used as a filling for tacos or enchiladas. Many people like chili with a small amount of grated low-fat cheese or toasted tortilla chips.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  soybeans
       1           cup  pinto beans
     1/2           cup  whole wheat berries
      10   milliliters  garlic -- minced
       2        medium  onions -- chopped
       2   tablespoons  oil
       1           cup  tofu -- cubed
       2     teaspoons  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  powdered oregano
       1                bell pepper -- chopped
   1 1/4          cups  tomato sauce
                        tomatoes -- chopped
                        -- water

Cook beans and wheat until tender (usually 3-4 hours or about 35 minutes in a pressure cooker). Saute the garlic and onions in the oil. Add the tofu and cook lightly. Stir in spices and peppers, then add the sauce and tomatoes. If this is too thick (it should be the consistency of a sauce), thin with more tomato sauce. Simmer for about 20 minutes to allow the tofu to absorb the flavors. Stir the sauce into the cooked beans; then add water until the proper consistency is reached. Simmer gently an additional hour or so. If possible, improve the flavor by letting the chili stand before serving and then reheating.   6-8 servings

                        shredded or thinly sliced
       1                ripe tomato -- sliced
                        thinly sliced red onion
                        cilantro leaves
                        coarsely chopped
                        soft butter

SPREAD EACH PIECE OF BREAD with thin coating of pureed chiles, or more if you like your sandwich really hot. Cover bottom slice with layer of cheese, tomato and onion slices and as much cilantro as you like. Top with second slice of bread and butter it. Place sandwich, butter-side down, in cast-iron skillet. Spread top piece of bread with butter as well and cook sandwich slowly. When golden brown on bottom, turn it over and cook on the other side. Covering pan will help melt cheese by the time bread is crisped and golden. Eat right away with something very cold to drink.

       2         pound  japanese or round eggplants
                        oil -- for frying
       3    tablespoon  virgin olive oil
       1                red onion -- finely chopped
       1                garlic clove -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  herbes de Provence
   2 1/2         pound  ripe tomatoes
                        peeled -- seeded and chopped
                        salt
                        pepper -- freshly milled
                        sugar -- if needed
     1/8      teaspoon  saffron threads
       2                eggs
       1           cup  ricotta cheese
     1/3           cup  milk or whipping cream
     1/2           cup  grated parmesan cheese
      10            lg  basil leaves -- cut or torn
                        into small pieces
       3         ounce  gruyere cheese
                        shredded or thinly sliced

SLICE EGGPLANTS diagonally about 1/2-inch thick. Discard pieces that are all skin on one side. If using round eggplants, halve them lengthwise, then cut into 1/2 or 1/4 rounds, about 1/2-inch thick. Generously cover bottom of wide skillet with oil. When hot, add eggplant in single layer and fry until golden on both sides and flesh is tender. Drain on paper towels. Add more oil, if needed, and fry rest of eggplant. Make sure oil is hot each time you add a new batch. FOR SAUCE: Warm olive oil in skillet and add onion, garlic and herbs. Stir to coat onion with oil. Cook gently until onions soften, 12 to 15 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes, salt lightly and raise heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until juice has evaporated and sauce is thick, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If tomatoes are on the acid side, add sugar to taste to correct balance. FOR CUSTARD: Cover saffron threads with a few tablespoons hot water and let stand a few minutes. In bowl, beat eggs and stir in ricotta cheese, milk and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in saffron with liquid. FOR GRATIN: Spread a little tomato sauce over bottom of baking dish, then arrange a layer of eggplant slices, slightly overlapping. Season with salt and pepper, scatter half the basil, add Gruyere. Make another basil-eggplant layer. Cover with rest of the tomato sauce. Pour custard over the top. Preheat oven to 350F and bake 40 minutes or until custard sets and is a delicate golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to rest a few minutes before serving. DEBORAH MADISON ~ PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK

RINSE THE RICE, cover it with water and set it aside to soak while you prepare the rest of the vegetables. Preheat the oven to 375F. Warm the oil and butter in a large skillet. Add the eggplant and onion, salt them lightly, and rapidly saute them to distribute the oil. Cook over medium heat until the eggplant is soft but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Add the peppers, tomatoes, spices (including the pepper), parsley and more salt to taste. Stir carefully, combining everything well. Drain the rice and add it to the pan along with 3 cups water. Turn up the heat to bring the water to a boil, then transfer everything to a baking dish, such as a large, earthenware gratin dish. Lay a piece of parchment over the top, cover with foil, and bake until the rice is done, about 45 minutes. Toss the diced cheese, if you're using it, into the rice and serve. Serves 4 as a main course or 6 to 8 as a side dish.

Add the onion, celery, and garlic and saute over low heat until the onion is translucent. Sprinkle in the flour, stirring until well blended. Add the herbs and saute, stirring until the mixture just begins to brown. Add the milk and the diced eggplant (about 1 1/2 lbs). Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant is quite tender. Add a bit of water from time to time if necessary, just enough to keep the bottom of the skillet moist. Remove from the heat. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl. Add the bread crumbs, cheese, salt and pepper to taste, cayenne, and 3 egg yolks. In another bowl, beat the 3 egg whites until they form stiff peaks, then fold them gently into the eggplant mixture. Pour the mixture into a well-oiled 1 1/2 qt baking casserole or souffle pan. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown. Let the souffle sit for 5 minutes, then serve at once. Serves 4-6.

Put into the just-boiling milk and stir briskly until there are no lumps. Simmer over very low heat for 20 minutes. Meanwhile boil the sun-dried tomatoes in the 2 cups of water; do not drain. Strain the milk mixture, add the tomatoes and their liquid, and simmer another 5 minutes.

 In a blender, in batches, liquefy the soup. Return to the stove and bring just to a boil. Add the optional cream, if desired, and serve in hot bowls garnished with a minced green herb. PETER KUMP - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK

Reserve a few mushroom slices for garnish and chop the remaining mushrooms coarsely, then place in a food processor with a steel blade and chop as finely as possible. Strain the milk mixture through a fine sieve back into the saucepan; add the chopped mushrooms and continue simmering 5 minutes. Add the cream and Madeira, if you wish, and serve in hot bowls, garnished with a slice of mushroom.

This was one of the most popular dishes at Greens Restaurant in San Francisco.

 COOK RICE. SET THE TOFU on a slanted board or pan to drain, and prepare the vegetables. Chop the onion, carrots, celery, pepper, and zucchini into pieces about 1/2-inch square. Quarter mushrooms if they are small, and cut them into sixths or eighths if they are large. Cut the tofu into 1/2-inch cubes. Heat the olive oil and the butter and fry the onion over medium heat until it is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, nutritional yeast, if using, cumin and salt. Stir until blended and cook for 1 minute. Add the carrots, celery, green pepper and 1/2 cup of the liquid, cover pan, and braise the vegetables until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the zucchini and mushrooms and cook 7 to 10 minutes. The vegetables should be nearly, but not completely, cooked. If the pan gets dry while they cook, add a little more liquid. Preheat oven to 350F. Combine the vegetables with rice and cheese. Season with salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Gently mix in the tofu, and put mixture into lightly oiled casserole. Add a little more liquid to moisten. Cover with foil and bake 1/2 hour. Remove foil and bake 15 minutes. Garnish with fresh herbs.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6         ounce  roquefort
                        =or=- other blue cheese
       6    tablespoon  unsalted butter
       1    tablespoon  cognac (optional)
                        freshly ground pepper
       2    tablespoon  finely chopped walnuts
       4                sl -- bread (thin)

Serve these Blue Cheese Toasts surrounding a salad made of finely shredded bitter greens--radicchio, butter lettuce, endive--and dressed with a walnut oil vinaigrette.

 PREHEAT THE OVEN OR BROILER for the toast. Cream the cheese and butter together. Add the cognac, if using, season with pepper and stir in the walnuts. Toast the bread lightly on both sides. Spread the cheese over the toast, then return it to the oven or broiler just long enough for the butter and cheese to melt into the toast a little. It shouldn't melt completely, but just soften. Remove the toasts from the oven, dust them with more pepper and cut them into smaller pieces. Serve warm. Cool, juicy slices of pears would make a perfect accompaniment to the cheese and walnuts.

THE SAUCE: Bruise the hard spices with a pestle and add them to the cream mixture along with the cinnamon, herbs and half the jalapeno. Slowly bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let steep while you cut the vegetables.

 THE VEGETABLES: Heat the oil in a wide skillet and add the onion. Saute briskly for a minute or so; add zucchini, corn, remaining jalapeno from above and season with salt. Continue to saute over fairly high heat for about 5 minutes. The zucchini and onion may color slightly. Pour the steeped cream from the sauce instructions directly into the pan through a strainer. Add the tomato and simmer for several minutes. Simmer until the sauce has reduced and thickened a little and the zucchini is done. Season to taste with salt and serve garnished with chopped cilantro.

       1         pound  asparagus (preferably white)
       2         quart  :boiling water mixed with
       4      teaspoon  salt
       1                (9-in) unbaked pie shell
       3         ounce  well aged emmenthaler cheese
                        coarsely grated
     3/4           cup  milk
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
       2            md  eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  freshly grated parmesan
       1    tablespoon  kirschwasser
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2    tablespoon  finely snipped fresh dill or
     1/2      teaspoon  dill weed
     1/4      teaspoon  ground mace
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper

Emmenthaler is a dry, aged cheese that accents the flavor of asparagus. Serve as the main course of a light lunch or supper. PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Snap coarse ends off asparagus stalks leaving spears about 3 1/2-inches long. (Save the trimmed-off ends to use for soup.) Peel the asparagus spears using a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, lay them flat in a large heavy skillet, pour in boiling salted water and set over moderate heat. Cover and cook asparagus for about 10 minutes, until very tender. Drain well, return to the skillet and shake over moderate heat for 30 seconds or so to dissipate any excess moisture. Arrange the asparagus spears like the spokes of a wheel over the bottom of the pie crust, with their tips pointing toward the center. Combine the milk, cream, eggs, Parmesan cheese, Kirschwasser, salt, dill, mace and pepper, and pour the liquid evenly over the asparagus. Bake the tart, uncovered, for 35 minutes, or until the filling has set. Remove the tart from the oven and cool it for at least 20 minutes before cutting.

       2            tb  Margarine or oil

   Soak the dried corn husks in cold water for 1 hour.


 For the filling, soak the TVP in 7/8 c. hot water for
  5 minutes. 

Saute the olive oil, onion, garlic and
  green pepper in a skillet.


Add the chili powder, cumin, garlic salt, tomato
  puree and cayenne to the reconstituted TVP. 

Mix TVP
  and onions and heat together for 2 minutes.

Taste the
  filling and add a little hot sauce, if desired.
  


To make the masa dough, place the masa harina and
  salt into a bowl. Slowly add enough warm water (about
  1 1/2 cups) to make a firm but moist dough, working in
  the margarine or oil as you knead the mixture.

To form the tamales, use the palm of your hand to
  slap-pat the masa dough into flat patties a
  quarter-inch thick.

Fold patty around a spoonful of
  filling and place in a drained corn husk. Fold the
  husk over to enclose the filling. If husks are small
  or broken, use several pieces. 

Place 1 cup hot water
  in thebottom of a kettle, place a steamer rack in the
  kettle and stack tamales on rack. Cover pan, bring
  water to a boil, reduce heat and steam tamales 45
  minutes.

   1 1/2     teaspoons  chopped fresh basil
       4   thin slices  reduced-fat mozzarella cheese
       2          cups  tomato sauce -- warmed

In a small saucepan, combine the broth, white rice and wild rice. Bring to
a boil over medium heat. Cover, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20
minutes, or until the rice is tender and the broth has been absorbed. Set
aside.

Cut the tops off the peppers, about 1" down. Remove the seeds and ribs,
being careful not to tear or rip the peppers. If necessary, trim the
pepper bottoms so that they stand upright. Blanch the peppers in gently
boiling water for 6 minutes, or until the peppers are soft but still
retain their shape. Drain well and set aside.

In a large no-stick skillet over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the onions
and sauti for 4 minutes, or until tender. Add the garlic, peas, corn and
carrots. Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from
the heat. Stir in the rice, shredded mozzarella and basil.

Preheat the oven to 375:.

Stuff the peppers with the rice mixture; top each with a slice of
mozzarella. Place the peppers upright in an 8" W 8" no-stick baking dish.
Pour 1/4" water into the dish. Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated
through. Turn on the broiler and broil about 6" from the heat for 3
minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned and bubbly. Serve with the
tomato sauce.

Mix together all ingredients except the butter and oil. Put half of the butter in half of the oil in a skillet heated to medium, brown onions and potatoes cut in small dice. Cover for five minutes to help the potatoes cook, then uncover to make them crunchy. Add remaining butter and oil to another skillet heated to medium and add the egg mixture. Using a small spatula run around the edges of the skillet, tipping the skillet so the uncooked egg from the center of the pan can run under the bottom of the cooked egg. Continue to do this until the egg in the center is still just a little moist, sprinkle sautied onions and potatoes on the omelet, roll the omelet with three folds as you turn it onto the plate.

     1/4           cup  sugar
       2      packages  Fleischmann's. Active Dry or Rapid Rise
                        Yeast
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt
     3/4           cup  warm milk (105: to 115:F)

Beat remaining egg; brush on rolls. If desired, sprinkle with poppy or
sesame seed. Bake at 375:F for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove from sheets or pans; cool on wire racks.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        REQUIRED INGREDIENTS
       2        pounds  cauliflower -- cut into bite-size-pieces
     1/4           cup  yogurt (thick)
       1           cup  chick pea flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  carom seed (ajwain in Hindi/vaamu in Telug
     1/4      teaspoon  red chili powder

                        Oil -- to deep fry

In a bowl mix all the ingredients except cauliflower pieces. The batter must have the same consistency as that of a cake.

Dip cauliflower pieces in the batter such that they are completely covered with the batter.

In a deep skillet heat oil on medium and when oil is hot add the batter-covered cauliflower pieces. Fry until this batch is about half done (just about when the color of the batter starts to change) and remove from heat and keep aside.

Do the same for all the batches. In the end take the first batch and refry them until they turn brown. Repeat for the other batches. 

Goes well with ketchup.

     1/4           Cup  Honey
       1      Teaspoon  Vanilla
       1    Tablespoon  Lemon Juice

Put the agar and water in a saucepan and heat until agar granules are dissolved. Agar flakes may require simmering several minutes before they are ready; follow the directions on the jar. When agar water is ready, remove from the heat and cool to lukewarm. Put agar water and remaining ingredients into a blender and whip for one minute. Pour the mixture into an ice cream freezer. Following the freezer instructions, freeze until firm. Store ice cream in the refrigerator freezer until ready to serve.

VARIATIONS: Omit one cup of water and add one cup of fruit pulp just before pouring into the freezer. Bananas, strawberries, or peaches make excellent fruit-flavored ice creams. For carob ice cream, add 1/4 cup carob flour. Add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans for a delicious flavor and a crunchy texture. Substitute any kind of nut or seed butter for cashew butter.

Drain on a paper towel. Cut pitas in half. Place two falafel in each pocket and sprinkle with lettuce and drizzle with Tahini Sauce.

TAHINI SAUCE:
Place tahini, lemon juice, garlic and salt in food processor fitted with metal blade. Process until smooth, adding enough water to make a thin sauce. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

                        beans
       3          cups  water
       4     teaspoons  chili powder
       2     teaspoons  cumin
       1     teaspoons  paprika
       1     teaspoons  oregano
       1    tablespoon  lemon juice
                        salt -- pepper to taste
                        tabasco to taste
       1           cup  textured vegetable protein

Saute onions, garlic, and peppers in oil until onions are translucent. Add spices and simmer for two minutes. Stir in remaining ingredients, adding the TVP last. You can adjust the amount of TVP to obtain the desired texture and consistency. You can substitute beer for the water for a more unique flavor. One jalapeno makes a mild chili (two were used for the cookoff). Simmer from four to six hours. It's even better the next day.

     3/4           cup  apricot all-fruit spread
       3     teaspoons  Dijon mustard
       2     teaspoons  fennel seeds -- crushed

       8        medium  mushrooms
       8                cherry tomatoes

TO MAKE THE APRICOT-FENNEL BASTING SAUCE: In a small bowl, whisk together
the all-fruit spread, mustard, fennel seeds and enough of the water to
make a saucy, spreadable consistency.<BR><BR>

TO MAKE THE VEGETABLES: Cut the sweet potatoes, eggplant, squash,
zucchini, red or green peppers and yellow peppers into bite-size pieces.
Place the sweet potatoes in a small saucepan. Add 1" of water, cover and
simmer for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are crisp-tender.
Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again.<BR><BR>

Thread the sweet potatoes, eggplant, squash, zucchini, red or green
peppers, yellow peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes on 8 long metal or wooden
skewers to make kebabs.<BR><BR>

Preheat the broiler. Broil the kebabs 5" from the heat or grill over
medium-hot coals for a total of 8 to 10 minutes, or until the vegetables
are tender. Baste several times with the basting sauce. Turn the kebabs
halfway through the cooking time.<BR><BR>

       3         small  carrots -- diced
       2         small  parsnips -- diced
       1        medium  turnip -- cut in chunks
       2        stalks  celery -- diced
       1         large  onion -- stuck with 2 cloves
       1           can  tomatoes -- with liquid
       1           can  tomato paste
       1  small   bunch  parsley -- flat-leaf
       1                bay leaf
                        fresh rosemary and thyme
                        black peppercorns

Put 3 quarts of water in the bottom of a large stock pot with a pasta insert. Add the tomato liquid and
tomato paste. Put all of the other ingredients in the pasta insert. Bring to a boil over high heat, lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 3 hours. 

Lift out the pasta insert, letting out the liquid fall back into the pot. Press down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible and return all the liquid to the pot. Discard the solids.  Note: This started out to be vegetable stock to use up some leftover stuff I had on hand, but after I strained the stock I decided to use it as a cooking liquid for pasta. The pasta thickened and flavored the stock to such an extent that I decided to save the leftovers to use as a tomato-vegetable soup. I may add some vegetables and small pasta to that.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         clove  garlic -- minced
       2   tablespoons  olive oil -- extra-virgin
       2         pound  asparagus -- trimmed and cut into
       2     teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper -- freshly ground
       4           cup  vegetable broth 
       4                eggs
     1/2           cup  parmesan* -- *fresly grated, PLUS
       6         slice  Italian bread -- toasted

In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender, about 15 minutes.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce the heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into the soup in the saucepan.  

Increase the heat to moderately low and cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just thickens, about 8 minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs will curdle. Remove from the heat.  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the hot soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.  

Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from day-old or slightly stale bread.

       1    tablespoon  Garlic -- minced
     1/2           cup  Olive oil

Wash artichokes; remove outer leaves until pale yellow leaves are exposed. Cut off top two inches and stems so artichokes will sit upright. Remove fuzzy centers and rub all surfaces with half of lemon. Add juice of remaining lemon to water and dip artichokes to preserve green color.

Mix mint and garlic with 1/4 cup olive oil and spoon into hollows of artichokes. Place in pan just large enough to hold them upright. Add water to depth of three inches, remaining olive oil and salt to taste. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 25 minutes or until just tender.

Cooking will vary with size of artichokes. Remove artichokes, drain and hold warm. Reduce cooking liquid until of a syrupy consistency. Spoon sauce over artichokes and serve.

       3   tablespoons  Peanut oil
       2     teaspoons  Salt
       1      teaspoon  Sesame oil

                        Chinese parsley garnish
       3     teaspoons  Thin soy sauce

Remove heads and tails from radishes; wash. Using bottom of heavy drinking glass, about 2" across base, hit radishes on side to crack them not mash them so dressing can get into flesh. 

Avoid rendering a crushing blow no matter how you feel that day. Sprinkle radishes all over with salt, put them in a bowl, and set aside for about 15 minutes at room temperature.

Prepare dressing Combine vinegar, sugar, thin soy sauce, peanut oil, sesame oil and fresh ginger juice. Double amount of vinegar for a sharper taste, if desired. 

Drain liquid from radishes (salt will have drawn off quite a bit of water); pour dressing over them; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

If you make this dish ahead of time, pour on dressing 30 minutes before serving. Immediately before serving, transfer radishes to serving dish; garnish with Chinese parsley and serve.

NOTES : The above recipe is based on an Indonesian dish traditionally made with peanuts. We are using almonds here. Peanuts are not recommended. A fungus called aflatoxin naturally occurs in the peanut crop. Although the crops are inspected for it, a certain percentage is allowed and since it is a proven carcinogen, peanuts are best left alone. Another reason peanut butter isnt recommended is that it is not possible to make a butter out of raw peanuts. Peanut butter is produced from roasted peanuts.

                     Agnolotti di Ricotta e Spinaci

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time : 1:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  flour
       6        ounces  sweet cream butter
       8                eggs
       3       pinches  salt -- to taste
      15        ounces  Ricotta cheese -- dry as possible
       2        ounces  spinach -- trimmed,washed
      13        ounces  Parmesan cheese -- grated
       1         Pinch  black pepper -- to taste
       2       pinches  nutmeg -- to taste
       1         quart  heavy cream
       4        ounces  Mascarpone cheese
       2       pinches  white pepper -- to taste

STEP ONE: The Dough--
Combine the following ingredients: 1 pound bleached flour, 2 ounces sweet butter, 5 eggs, and 1 pinch salt. Work the dough long enough to allow the butter to be incorporated inside the dough. Wrap the dough in a towel and let it rest, for at least one hour, inside the refrigerator.

STEP TWO: The Filling--
For the filling, steam the spinach and chop it very fine. In a bowl, beat together 2 eggs with 7 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese, 1 pinch each: salt, black pepper, and nutmeg. Add 15 ounces dry Ricotta cheese and mix very well, but not too long. If you mix it too much, the mixture will become liquid.

STEP THREE: The Agnolotti--
Roll out the dough in a thin layer and brush it with an egg wash (made from 1 egg). With the help of a teaspoon to make a "walnut" shape, place the spoon on the dough and cover it with another layer. Cut with a round pasta cutter 2 inches in diameter. Stuff the pasta with the filling and cook in boiling water until the agnolotti come to the surface of the boiling water.

STEP FOUR: The Sauce--
For the sauce, bring 1 quart heavy cream to a slow boil and add 4 ounces sweet butter, 6 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese, 4 ounces Mascarpone cheese, 1 pinch of salt, 1 pinch of nutmeg, 2 pinches white pepper. Boil slowly for five minutes, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon.

Serve agnolotti on warm plates with warm sauce.
